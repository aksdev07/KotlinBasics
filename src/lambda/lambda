Lambda functions are special functions which are not defined, but are passed immediately as expression.

Syntax :

val someName : Type = { arguments -> functionBody }
Except functionBody, everything else is optional.
The following lambda will calculate the square of a given number.

val squareLambda = { number: Int -> number * number }
println(squareLambda(5))
